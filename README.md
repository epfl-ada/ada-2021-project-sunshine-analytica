# Quote correlation
## Abstract
In today's connected world, news spread fast. When a public figure makes an announcement of some kind, it doesn't take long time for the rest of the world to obtain the information and possibly act on it.

The aim of this project is to investigate this phenomena by analyzing the  correlation among speeches made by different persons within some category (e.g. politicians, movie stars etc.). For instance, a quote of one politician might spread within the community and trigger an action, in the form of a quote, from another politician. Hence, by using the QuoteBank dataset, we will try to see if it is possible to identify speakers whose time of quotings are highly correlated. If time permits, we will refine this study by also including a quote similarity score when calculating the quote correlation. By including this, we aim for being more confident that the response quote actually is related with the preceding quote in terms of content.
## Research Questions
* Is there a high correlation between intra-quote time for some pairs of politicians?
* Does some pair of politicians make similar quotes in terms of content?
* By utilizing both intra-quote time and quote similarity, is it possible to identify pairs of politicians that use to act and respond to each others quotes?
## Proposed additional datasets
To be able to categorize the speakers in the QuoteBank dataset, we plan to use the provided metadata set, which was collected from Wikidata.
