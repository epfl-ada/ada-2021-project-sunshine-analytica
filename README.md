# Quote correlation in QuoteBank
## Abstract
In today's connected world, news spread fast. When a public figure makes an announcement of some kind, it doesn't take long time for the rest of the world to obtain the information and possibly act on it.

The aim of this project is to investigate this phenomena by analyzing the  correlation among speeches made by different persons within some category (e.g. politicians, movie stars etc.). For instance, a quote of one politician might spread within the community and trigger an action, in the form of a quote, from another politician. Hence, by using the QuoteBank dataset, we will try to see if it is possible to identify speakers whose time of quotings are highly correlated. If time permits, we will refine this study by also including a quote similarity score when calculating the quote correlation. By including this, we aim for being more confident that the response quote actually is related with the preceding quote in terms of content.
## Research Questions
We have chosen to begin by analysing quote correlation among politicians. However, the proposed method can be used for doing the same for other catogories of speakers. Hence we will aim for answering the following research questions:
* Is there a high correlation between time of quoting for some pairs of politicians?
* Does some pair of politicians make similar quotes in terms of content?
* By utilizing both quote time correlation and quote similarity, is it possible to identify pairs of politicians that use to act and respond to each others quotes?
  
Note that the part about analyzing the similarity of quote content will be added if time permits, if not, we will only consider the time correlation in our analysis and not include quote similarity.
## Proposed additional datasets
To be able to categorize the speakers in the QuoteBank dataset, we plan to use the provided metadata set, which was collected from Wikidata. 
## Methods
<!-- 
To begin with, we plan to only use quotes from a limited time span, e.g. for one particular year. This is because ....

### Data collection
The first step will be to collect quotes from QuoteBank that were made by people from the selected category, i.e. politicians. This will be done using the provided metadata set which lists, among other speaker attributes, the occupation of the speaker.
### Analyzing correlation between time of quoting
A fairly basic way to study the correlation between quotes from several politicians is to simply study the temporal correlation between their speeches.
We extract the dates of each politician's quotes and we make a signal representing the number of quotes of each politician per week of the year. We can then apply temporal signal analysis tools such as the cross-correlation.
### Quote similarity analysis
There exists many well established methods for quantifying the similarity between texts. In this project, we plan to use techniques from vector space retrieval, where the quotes first are transformed into a vector space. These vectors are then compared to each other using the cosine distance; where vectors with a small distance are considered to be similar. One way of transforming the quotes into a vector space is to use a vector of weights for some terms. As weights one can use the TF-IDF score, defined as follows:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=tf(i,j) \cdot idf(i)">

where `tf(i,j)` is the term frequency of term `i` in document `j`, and `idf(i)` is the inverse document frequency, defined as:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=idf(i) = log\left(\frac{n}{n_i}\right)">

where `n` is the total number of documents (or quotes in this context) and `n_i` the total number of documents in which term `i` occur. [1] An advantage of using TF-IDF scores as weights instead of only the counts of the term, is that the `idf` part compensates for how common a term is in the collection of documents (quotes). This would make the vector representation more accurately reflect the distinction of quotes.
